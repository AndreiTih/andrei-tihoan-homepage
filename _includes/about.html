    <p>
      Andrei Tihoan loves programming, reading, and uncovering the inner-workings of computers. He recently graduated from The University of Sheffield with a First-Class Master's degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. While there was little C/C++ work being done during university, he personally felt very curious about the "magic" of technology. He had many questions like: What is virtual memory? How does multi-threading work? How does software interact with hardware? His <a href="{{ site.nav.main.projects }}">projects</a> and <a href="{{ site.nav.main.writing }}">writing</a> detail his attempts to answer these questions.
