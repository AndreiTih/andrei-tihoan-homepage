Listen up, developers. You are not special. Your infrastructure is not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You have the 
same tech debt as everyone else. So why are you reinventing the wheel? Why are you building the same infrastructure, 
from scratch, over and over again?

This is my talk from HashiConf 2017 about a better way to build and manage infrastructure: Terraform Modules. It
goes over how to build infrastructure as code, package that code into reusable modules, design clean and flexible
APIs for those modules, write automated tests for the modules, and combine multiple modules into an end-to-end
techs tack in minutes.

To get access to a collection of reusable, battle-tested, commercially supported Terraform modules that have been 
proven in production at dozens of companies, check out the
