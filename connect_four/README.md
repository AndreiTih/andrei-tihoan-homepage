# Connect 4 game

An implementation of a connect 4 game design provided by [frontendmentor](https://frontendmentor.io).

## Technologies

1. Built with: JavaScript, HTML and SCSS.
2. Hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
3. The framework I'm using to serve the website is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
1. I used [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and
   [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for styling.

# Running the code

To serve the code exactly as I do, move back a directory in this repo to andrei-tihoan-homepage (TODO: learn how to do a repo relative link) and follow the instructions laid out there.

<br>

The game plays entirely on the browser however, so one could just copy all the assets and serve index.html on an arbitrary route defined by a server framework of your choice.

// Add here some kind of video or something showing the game, not that it's super necessary but it fills out the page
