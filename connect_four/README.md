# Connect 4 game

An implementation of a Connect 4 game design provided by [frontendmentor](https://frontendmentor.io).

## Technologies

1. Built with: JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS.
2. Hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
3. The framework I'm using to serve the website is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
1. I used [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and
   [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for styling.

# Running the code

To serve the code exactly as I do, move back a directory in this repo to andrei-tihoan-homepage (TODO: learn how to do a repo relative link) and follow the instructions laid out there.

The game plays entirely on the browser. One could just copy all the assets and serve index.html on an arbitrary route defined by the server framework of their choice.
