# Connect 4 game

An implementation of a Connect 4 game design provided by [frontendmentor](https://frontendmentor.io).

## Technologies

1. Built with: JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS.
2. Hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
3. I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to serve the website. 
4. I used [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and
   [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for styling.

# Running the code

To serve the code in the same manner as this repo, move back a directory to [andrei-tihoan-homepage](https://github.com/AndreiTih/andrei-tihoan-homepage) and follow the instructions in README.md.

The game plays entirely on the browser. One could just copy all the assets and serve index.html on an arbitrary route defined by the server framework of their choice.
